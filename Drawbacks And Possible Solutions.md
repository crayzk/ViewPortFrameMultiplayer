--[[ ViewPortFrame Briefingâ€¦
DRAWBACKS:
1-No lighting
SOLUTION(s): wait until roblox changes that in the next update
2- Must accurately render TWO entire maps, and other players accurately
(so take your part count * 2)
+PROS: each player can still have local effects!
SOLUTION(s): turn the "REAL" map invisible and remove unimportant textures and meshes
Other character positions can be read from the server, and copied to the
ViewPortModels.
3- Players (and player methods) must use this module.
SOLUTION(s): custom GetPlayerFromCharacter, GetPlayers, LoadCharacter, and other
things must be reworked in and put into the module.
Player 2 is simply a folder within Player 1, Player2 can leave any time, both players
leave when Player1 leaves
